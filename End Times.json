  "description": "Every human soul is a book that contains its life's story. Joel Christmas lives a double life, where the author of his story, who lives in heaven (The Fast Realm), and the proofreader, who lives on earth (The Slow Realm), struggle to get on the same page. The 7 spine binders, who represent the chakras, hold the book of life together. In order to become a self-actualized human, Joel must be a bridge across all 7 of them, while living in the alleged \"End Times\"\n\nhttps://www.wappinanimation.com/poster.png <- Chart that serves at a blueprint for the world I'm creating.  It is in my humble opinion, the best cosmological chart ever made.\nIt is also available for purchase as a poster here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/1578047590/12-universal-energies-metaphysical\n\nIt's been well over a year since I wrote this first chapter, but much more is in the works. The depth and scope of the world I'm building has expanded to a degree I never imagined, and will be a series of novels in addition to future artwork and comics. Thank you for reading!",
